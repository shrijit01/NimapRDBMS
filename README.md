Project Setup Guide:

Clone the project repository from version control (e.g., Git).

Install Node.js and npm if not already installed on your system.

Navigate to the project directory in the terminal.

Run npm install to install project dependencies.

Set up your database and configure database connection details in config/db.js.

Run the database migration scripts to create the necessary tables.

Start the server by running npm start or node app.js.

Access the application in your web browser using the specified port (default is 3000).

This setup guide assumes you have Node.js, npm, and a database (e.g., MySQL) installed and configured on your system. Make sure to replace placeholder values with actual values according to your environment.


With this setup, you should have a functional web application for managing categories and products, with API endpoints for performing CRUD operations.
